            <p class="content-description">I have had a career in the software developer field for approximately 2 years and have had a lot of work experience in the form of projects from companies and personal projects.</p>
            <p class="content-description">A little story about my journey to a career in the world of technology. Initially I was a worker with a background as a laborer in an automotive factory and as time went by I became interested in pursuing a career in the world of technology because I often saw programming content on YouTube. Not long after that I decided My first online course was Codepolitan. I studied at Codepolitan for about 1 year and managed to complete the fullstack class accompanied by several professional mentors (please check it on the site www.klasfullstack.id)</p>
            <p class="content-description">After I finished the fullstack class, it was time for me to deepen my knowledge related to working as a software developer, including personal branding, English language, critical thinking, problem solving, etc. I studied it at the Bearmentor bootcamp and the Asian Cyber ​​University located in Indonesia</p>
